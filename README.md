# ðŸšŒ Ember Trip Page

This project implements a self-contained Trip Info page for Ember, designed to give passengers a clear, mobile-friendly view of their upcoming journey.

The page shows:

- A **live map** with the current location of the bus (if available)
- A list of **all stops** on the trip, with both **scheduled** and **estimated** arrival times
- Highlighting of the **next stop** based on live data
- Graceful handling of missing or outdated GPS data

The goal is to create a sharable, real-time view that could be sent via SMS to a passenger, providing meaningful trip info in a simple interface.
